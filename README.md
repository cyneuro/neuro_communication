# neuro_communication

1. Single cell example (1 comp.) as a basic hardware unit for communication
2. PING as a potential basis for generating oscillations
3. Neural activity recordings as a hardware indicator of communication
  3.1. LFP as a measurement of oscillations
  3.2. fMRI
  3.3. EEG (+eeglab)
5. DCM for functional connectivity estimation (during communication)
6. Communication hypotheses (Vinck, spatial computing, etc.)
7. +Hardware: Traveling waves? +Software: Predictive coding? â€“ other motifs to help communication
