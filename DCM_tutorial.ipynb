Proposed brain regions and potential connections between regions are specified in one or more candidate models.\n",

Approximates the log marginal likelihood for each model using variational free energy. Comparing the free energy of candidate models enalbes the model that best explains the data to be selected.\n",

    "    - **Bayesian Model Selection (BMS):** Multiple DCM models are optimized, where each describes a hypothesis about the connectivity between brain regions of interest. The model that best describes each participant's data is determined and the average connectivity parameters are determined using Bayesian Model Averaging, with each parameter a weighted average of the candidate models based on each's prior probability.\n",
    "    - **Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB):** Assumes that each participant varies in the strength of connection between regions. Models the soruces of variability in connection strengths across subjects using fixed and random effects. Specifies one DCM per subject and a Bayesian GLM to model parameters at the group level. Tests hypotheses by comparing the group level model to reduced group level models where certain combinations of connections are switched on and off to determine the best fit for the data. "

So, changes in normalized blood volume $V$ correspond to differences in flow $f_i$ and outflow $f_o$ with some time constant $\\tau$ where $\\tau$ represents the mean transit time for blood to traverse the venous compartment such that $ \\tau = \\frac{V_0}{f_0} = \\frac{\\text{resting blood volume}}{\\text{resting blood flow}}$.

So, the oxygen gradient across the capillary wall and oxygen extraction rate depend entirely on oxygen delivery, and as a result, blood flow.\n",

Hypotheses regarding model connectivity can be tested by comparing the \"full\" PEB with alternate PEBs with certain parameters switched off. The best model can be determined via comparison with variational laplace or if no model is a clear winner, Bayesian Model Averaging can be used. "
