    "The model consists of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Dynamic Causal Model:** A model that combines a bilinear model of neuronal dynamics with a neuroimaging method - specific model (based on hemodynamic or electrophysiological signatures). Proposed brain regions and potential connections between regions are specified in one or more candidate models.\n",
    "-  **Variational Laplace:** The process by which candidate model parameters are optimized and their uncertainty is determined. Approximates the log marginal likelihood for each model using variational free energy. Comparing the free energy of candidate models enalbes the model that best explains the data to be selected.\n",
    "-  **Model Selection & Comparison:** The process by which model structure is selected. There are two common approaches:\n",
    "    - **Bayesian Model Selection (BMS):** Multiple DCM models are optimized, where each describes a hypothesis about the connectivity between brain regions of interest. The model that best describes each participant's data is determined and the average connectivity parameters are determined using Bayesian Model Averaging, with each parameter a weighted average of the candidate models based on each's prior probability.\n",
    "    - **Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB):** Assumes that each participant varies in the strength of connection between regions. Models the soruces of variability in connection strengths across subjects using fixed and random effects. Specifies one DCM per subject and a Bayesian GLM to model parameters at the group level. Tests hypotheses by comparing the group level model to reduced group level models where certain combinations of connections are switched on and off to determine the best fit for the data. "

    "This model describes the transformation of neural activity into a BOLD response. The common hemodynamic model uses the \"balloon model\", which uses the analogy of an inflated balloon to describe the behavior of the postcapillary venous component of the blood vessels \"feeding\" the neurons to encourage activity. The model postulates a nonlinear dependence of the BOLD signal on blood volume $V$ and deoxyhemoglobin content $q$. It explores the evolution of $V$ and $q$ by two differential equations operating under the assumptions that: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Small post capillary blood vessels releact to an influx of blood like an inflating balloon. So, changes in normalized blood volume $V$ correspond to differences in flow $f_i$ and outflow $f_o$ with some time constant $\\tau$ where $\\tau$ represents the mean transit time for blood to traverse the venous compartment such that $ \\tau = \\frac{V_0}{f_0} = \\frac{\\text{resting blood volume}}{\\text{resting blood flow}}$. Outflow $f_o$ is modelled as a function of volume with parameter $\\alpha$ the resistance of the venous balloon: $f_o = v^{1/\\alpha}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Oxygen extraction is highly coupled to blood flow, so it determines the deoxyhemoglobin content $q$. Generally a change in $q$ refers to a delivery of deoxyhemoglobin into the venous compartment minus that expelled at a given time point. So, the oxygen gradient across the capillary wall and oxygen extraction rate depend entirely on oxygen delivery, and as a result, blood flow.\n",
